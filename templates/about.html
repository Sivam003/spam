        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our team is passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. The SpamHam project was born from our shared interest in applying machine learning to categorize email messages as either spam or ham. This project has allowed us to showcase our collective skills and contribute to a tool that can help users manage their inbox more efficiently.</p>

        <p>We are three dedicated team members who collaborated closely to make this project a reality:</p>

        <h3>Team Members and Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sivam Visnu</strong>:  Took charge of the front-end development, designing an intuitive, user-friendly interface and ensuring smooth navigation between the pages. He was responsible for integrating the front-end with the backend, enhancing the user experience through responsive and interactive design elements</li>
            <li><strong>Mehul Kumar</strong>: Focused on the backend integration, developing the Flask application to process user inputs and interact efficiently with the machine learning model. His work ensured seamless data flow and accurate predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Md. Shahid Hussain</strong>: Assisted in optimizing the backend logic, fine-tuning the model's performance, and handling the data preprocessing to ensure reliable classification results.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our combined efforts have led to a highly functional, user-oriented tool that makes email classification simple and efficient.</p>
